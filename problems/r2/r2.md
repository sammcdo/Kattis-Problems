    called the mean of two numbers **R_1** and **R_2** if **S** is equal to **(R_1+R_2)/2**. Mirko’s birthday
    present for Slavko was two integers **R_1** and **R_2**. Slavko promptly calculated
    their mean which also happened to be an integer but then lost
    **R_2**! Help Slavko restore
    **R_2**.
