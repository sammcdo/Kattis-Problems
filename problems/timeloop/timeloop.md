Last night when you went to sleep, you had a strange feeling
    that you may see the same day again. And your strange feeling
    came to bewhen you woke up, everyone seemed to think that it
    was yesterday morning! The same strange feeling came back in
    the evening.
When this pattern continued for days, you looked for help
    from a time wizard. The wizard says he can break you out of the
    time loop, but you must chant his spell. The wizard gives you a
    magic number, and you must count up to that number, starting at
    **1**, saying “Abracadabra”
    each time.
Input
Input consists of a single integer **N** (**1
    \le N \le 100**).
Output
Output the entire wizard’s spell by counting from
    **1** to **N**, giving one number and “Abracadabra” per line.
