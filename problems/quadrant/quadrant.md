A common problem in mathematics is to determine which
    quadrant a given point lies in. There are four quadrants,
    numbered from **1** to
    **4**, as shown in the
    diagram below:





For example, the point **A**, which is at coordinates
    **(12, 5)** lies in quadrant
    **1** since both its
    **x** and **y** values are positive, and point
    **B** lies in quadrant 2
    since its **x** value is
    negative and its **y** value
    is positive.
Your job is to take a point and determine the quadrant it is
    in. You can assume that neither of the two coordinates will be
    **0**.
Input
The first line of input contains the integer **x** (**-1000 \le x \le 1000; x \not= 0**).
    The second line of input contains the integer **y** (**-1000 \le y \le 1000; y \not=
    0**).
Output
Output the quadrant number (**1**, **2**, **3** or **4**) for the point **(x, y)**.
