Carrots are good for you! First of all, they give you
    good night vision. Instead of having your lights on at home,
    you could eat carrots and save energy! Ethnomedically, it has
    also been shown that the roots of carrots can be used to treat
    digestive problems. In this contest, you also earn a carrot for
    each difficult problem you solve, or huffle-puff problems as we
    prefer to call them.

    You will be given the number of contestants in a
    hypothetical contest, the number of huffle-puff problems that
    people solved in the contest and a description of each
    contestant. Now, find the number of carrots that will be handed
    out during the contest.
Input
Input starts with two integers **1 \le N, P \le 1\, 000** on a single
    line, denoting the number of contestants in the contest and the
    number of huffle-puff problems solved in total. Then follow
    **N** lines, each consisting
    of a single non-empty line in which the contestant describes
    him or herself. You may assume that the contestants are good at
    describing themselves, in a way such that an arbitrary
    5-year-old with hearing problems could understand it.
Output
Output should consist of a single integer: the number of
    carrots that will be handed out during the contest.
