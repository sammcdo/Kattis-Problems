On a **N \times N** chess
    board, two players alternate placing a knight on the board. A
    knight can only be placed if there is no other knight which
    would be either **1** row
    and **2** columns or
    **2** rows and **1** column away from it. The first
    player who cannot place a knight on the board loses.
Given the size of the board, compute if the first or second
    player wins.
Input
The first and only line contains the integer **N** (**1
    \le N \le 1000**), the size of the board.
Output
Output first if the first player
    wins the game, or second if the
    second player wins the game.
