Alice and Bob are playing a new game of stones. There are
    **N** stones placed on the
    ground, forming a sequence. The stones are labeled from
    **1** to **N**.
Alice and Bob in turns take exactly two consecutive stones
    on the ground until there are no consecutive stones on the
    ground. That is, each player can take stone **i** and stone **i+1**, where **1 \leq i \leq N - 1**. If the number
    of stone left is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.
Assume both Alice and Bob play optimally and Alice plays
    first, do you know who the winner is?
Input
The input contains an integer **N** **(1
    \leq N \leq 10\, 000\, 000)**, the number of stones.
Output
Output the winner, “Alice” or
    “Bob” (without the quotes), on a
    line.
