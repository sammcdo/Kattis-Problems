Every year, Pumpkin Pete comes up with a couple of different
    Jack-O’-Lantern ideas for his annual Halloween special. He
    stacks them up on haystacks for everyone to enjoy and take
    pictures with. To make sure that there’s a wide variety of
    displays, he wants to make sure many possible Jack-O’-Lanterns
    designs are available. He has come up with many eye, nose, and

    the special kicks off!
