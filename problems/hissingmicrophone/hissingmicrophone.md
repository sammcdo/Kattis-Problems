A known problem with some microphones is the “hissing s”.
    That is, sometimes the sound of the letter s is particularly
    pronounced; it stands out from the rest of the word in an
    unpleasant way.
Of particular annoyance are words that contain the letter s
    twice in a row. Words like amiss,
    kiss, mississippi and even hiss itself.
Input
The input contains a single string on a single line. This
    string consists of only lowercase letters (no spaces) and has
    between **1** and
    **30** characters.
Output
Output a single line. If the input string contains two
    consecutive occurrences of the letter s, then output hiss.
    Otherwise, output no hiss.
