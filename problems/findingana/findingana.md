In this problem, you are given a single string **s** that is guaranteed to contain the
    letter a.
You should output the suffix of **s** that begins with the first
    occurrence of the letter **a**. Namely, if **s** consists of characters
    **s_1s_2\ldots s_ n** and
    **i** is the first index
    with **s_ i = \texttt{a}**,
    then you should output the string **s_ is_{i+1}\ldots s_ n**.
