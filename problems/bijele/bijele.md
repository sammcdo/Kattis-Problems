Mirko has found an old chessboard and a set of pieces in his
    attic. Unfortunately, the set contains only white pieces, and
    apparently an incorrect number of them. A set of pieces
    should contain:


One king


One queen


Two rooks


Two bishops


Two knights


Eight pawns


Mirko would like to know how many pieces of each type he
    should add or remove to make a valid
    set.
Input
The input consists of **6** integers on a single line, each
    between **0** and
    **10** (inclusive). The
    numbers are, in order, the numbers of kings, queens, rooks,
    bishops, knights and pawns in the set Mirko found.
Output
Output should consist of **6** integers on a single line; the
    number of pieces of each type Mirko should add or remove. If a
    number is positive, Mirko needs to add that many pieces. If a
    number is negative, Mirko needs to remove pieces.
