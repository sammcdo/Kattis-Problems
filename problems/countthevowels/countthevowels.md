Given a line of text, count the vowels! For this problem,
    the only vowels are A, E, I, O and U, both upper
    and lower case. No other letters will be considered vowels for
    the purposes of this problem.
Input
The single line of input contains a single string
    **s** (**1 \le |s| \le 80**), which consists of
    ASCII text, with no special characters. There will be only
    letters, numbers, printable symbols, and spaces. There will be
    no control characters, and the only white space will be the
    space character. The string **s** is guaranteed to have at least one
    non-whitespace character
Output
Output a single line with a single integer, which is the
    number of vowels in **s**.
