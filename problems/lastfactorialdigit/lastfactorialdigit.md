Factorials on the complex plane, by 
        Dmitrii Kouznetsov


The factorial of **N**,
    written as **N!**, is
    defined as the product of all the integers from **1** to **N**. For example, **3! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 = 6**.
This number can be very large, so instead of computing the
    entire product, just compute the last digit of **N!** (when **N!** is written in
    base **10**).
Input
The first line of input contains a positive integer
    **1 \leq T \leq 10**, the
    number of test cases. Each of the next **T** lines contains a single positive
    integer **N**. **N** is at most **10**.
Output
For each value of **N**,
    print the last digit of **N!**.
