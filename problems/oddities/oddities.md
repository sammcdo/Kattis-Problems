Some numbers are just, well, odd. For example, the number
    **3** is odd, because it is
    not a multiple of two. Numbers that are a multiple of two are
    not odd, they are even. More precisely, if a number
    **n** can be expressed as
    **n = 2 \cdot k** for some
    integer **k**, then
    **n** is even. For example,
    **6 = 2 \cdot 3** is
    even.
Some people get confused about whether numbers are odd or
    even. To see a common example, do an internet search for the
    query “is zero even or odd?” (Don’t search for this now! You
    have a problem to solve!)
Write a program to help these confused people.
Input
Input begins with an integer **1 \leq n \leq 20** on a line by
    itself, indicating the number of test cases that follow. Each
    of the following **n** lines
    contain a test case consisting of a single integer **-10 \leq x \leq 10**.
Output
For each **x**, print
    either ‘**x** is odd’ or
    ‘**x** is even’ depending on
    whether **x** is odd or
    even.
