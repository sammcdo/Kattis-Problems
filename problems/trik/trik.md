Jealous of Mirko’s position as head of the village, Borko
    stormed into his tent and tried to demonstrate Mirko’s
    incompetence for leadership with a trick.
Borko puts three opaque cups onto the table next to each
    other (opening facing down) and a small ball under the leftmost
    cup. He then swaps two cups in one of three possible ways a
    number of times. Mirko has to tell which cup the ball ends up
    under.



Wise Mirko grins with his arms crossed while Borko struggles
    to move the cups faster and faster. What Borko does not know is
    that programmers in the back are recording all his moves and
    will use a simple program to determine where the ball is. Write
    that program.
Input
The first and only line contains a non-empty string of at
    most **50** characters,
    Borko’s moves. Each of the characters is ‘A’, ‘B’ or
    ‘C’ (without quote marks).
Output
Output the index of the cup under which the ball is:
    **1** if it is under the
    left cup, **2** if it is
    under the middle cup or **3** if it is under the right cup.
