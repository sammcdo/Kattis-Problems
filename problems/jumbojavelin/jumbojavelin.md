Jessica wants to become a javelin thrower, moreover she
    wants to become a famous one. However, she doesn’t want to
    train **40** hours a day. To
    avoid much training while still becoming famous, she has
    concocted a plan: make all her javelins gigantic.
As a software developer by day, she knows she needs a
    minimum viable javelin for testing, but also that you can glue
    existing things hastily together and get something that works
    alright.
She has a couple of steel rods next to her bed – as one does
    – and decides to go to the blacksmith apprentice Jack to get
    him to fuse them together.
The good thing about Jack is that he’ll fuse the steel rods
    together for free. But Jack isn’t that good at fusing things
    together. When fusing two rods, the fused rod will lose
    **1** cm of their combined
    length.
That’s not a problem for Jessica, but she wonders how big
    her javelin will become if Jack fuses all the rods
    together.
Input
The first line consist of an integer **N**, the number of steel rods she has.
    Then follows **N** lines,
    each containing a single integer **l_ i** representing the length of the
    steel rod in cm.
Output
Print out the length of the jumbo javelin Jack has made for
    her.
Limits
