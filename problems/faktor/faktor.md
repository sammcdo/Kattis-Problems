The impact factor of a scientific journal is a measure
    reflecting the average number of citations to articles
    published in science journals. For this task we are using a
    simplified formula for calculating the impact
    factor:\[ \frac{\text {Total
    count of citations received by articles published in the
    journal}}{\text {Total number of articles published}} \]
Rounding is always performed upwards. For example the impact
    factor of the “Journal for ore research and time wasting” that
    published **38** articles
    cited **894** times is
    **894 / 38 = 23.53**
    rounding up to **24**.
You are the editor of one scientific journal. You know how
    many articles you are going to publish and the owners are
    pushing you to reach a specific impact factor. You are
    wondering how many scientists you will have to bribe to cite
    your articles to meet the owners demands. Since money is tight
    you want to bribe the minimal amount of scientists. Each bribed
    scientist buys you a single citation.
Input
First and only line of input will contain **2** integers, **A** (**1
    \leq A \leq 100**), the number of articles you plan to
    publish and **I**
    (**1 \leq I \leq 100**), the
    impact factor the owners require.
Output
The first and only line of output should contain one
    integer, the minimal number of scientists you need to
    bribe.
