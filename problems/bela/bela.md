Young Mirko is a smart, but mischievous boy who often
    wanders around parks looking for new ideas. This time he’s come
    across pensioners playing the card game Belote. They’ve invited
    him to help them determine the total number of points in a
    game.
Each card can be uniquely determined by its number and suit.
    A set of four cards is called a hand. At the beginning of a
    game one suit that “trumps” any other is chosen, and it is
    called the dominant suit. The number of points in a game is
    equal to the sum of values of each card from each hand in the
    game. Mirko has noticed that the pensioners have played
    **N** hands and that suit
    **B** was the dominant
    suit.
The value of each card depends on its number and whether its
    suit is dominant, and is given in Table 1.

Table 1: Scores
        


Write a programme that will determine and output the number
    of points in the game.
Input
The first line contains the number of hands **N** (**1
    \leq N \leq 100**) and the value of suit **B** (S,
    H, D,
    C) from the task. Each of the
    following **4N** lines
    contains the description of a card (the first character is the
    number of the **i**-th card
    (A, K,
    Q, J,
    T, 9,
    8, 7), and
    the second is the suit (S, H, D, C)).
Output
The first and only line of output must contain the number of
    points from the task.
