Ann Britt-Caroline has a safe with a 2-digit code.
    Occasionally, she types in the code too fast, accidentally
    swapping the positions of the two digits. She has asked if you
    could program her safe to check if not only the 2-digit code
    she entered was correct, but if the code with the two digits
    swapped is also correct.
The first step in programming her safe in this manner is to
    write a program to swap the digits of a 2-digit code.
Input
The input consists of a single 2-digit code with only digits
    **1** to **9**, without any space between the
    digits.
Output
Output a single line with the swapped 2-digit code, without
    any space between the digits.
