We’re not going to sugar-coat it: Chicago’s winters can be
    rough. The temperatures sometimes dip to uncomfortable levels
    and, after last year’s “polar vortex”, the University of
    Chicago Weather Service wants to find out exactly how bad the
    winter was. More specifically, they are interested in knowing
    the total number of days in which the temperature was below
    zero degrees Celsius.
Input
The input is composed of two lines. The first line contains
    a single positive integer **n** (**1
    \le n \le 100**) that specifies the number of
    temperatures collected by the University of Chicago Weather
    Service. The second line contains **n** temperatures, each separated by a
    single space. Each temperature is represented by an integer
    **t** (**-1\, 000\, 000 \le t \le 1\, 000\,
    000**)
Output
You must print a single integer: the number of temperatures
    strictly less than zero.
