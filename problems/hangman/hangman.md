Hangman is a (somewhat macabre) word-guessing game that can
    be played by two people. Player **1** thinks of a word consisting of
    **n** letters, and draws a
    row of **n** dashes on a
    piece of paper. These dashes correspond to the letters of the
    word, in the same order. Player **2** then attempts to discover the word
    by making a sequence of letter guesses. For each letter guessed
    by Player **2**:


If the letter occurs one or more times in the word,
        Player **1** writes
        the letter above each corresponding dash.


If the letter does not occur in the word,
        Player **1** adds
        one component to a drawing of a stick-figure man hanging on
        a gallows. The drawing (initially empty) has **10** possible components: base,
        vertical beam, horizontal beam, rope, head, torso, right
        leg, left leg, right arm, left arm.


If Player **2**
    guesses all the letters in the word before the drawing of the
    hanging man is complete, then Player **2** wins (and Player **1** loses). Otherwise,
    Player **2** loses (and
    Player **1** wins).
Ned loves playing hangman, especially as
    Player **2**, but he
    finds that he is not a very good letter guesser. To improve his
    chances, he decides to adopt a new strategy. For each word
    selected by Player **1**, Ned chooses a random permutation
    of the letters of the alphabet, and then simply guesses letters
    in that order until he either wins or loses. Given the word and
    Ned’s permutation of the alphabet, determine the outcome of the
    game.
Input
The input consists of two lines representing a single game
    of Hangman. The first line contains the word to be guessed, a
    non-empty string of uppercase English alphabet letters
    (A–Z) of
    maximum length **16**. The
    second line contains a permutation of the **26** letters of the English alphabet,
    also uppercase.
Output
If Ned wins the game by guessing letters in the order given
    by the permutation (proceeding from left to right), output
    “WIN”. Otherwise, output “LOSE”.
