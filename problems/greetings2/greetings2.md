Now that Snapchat and Slingshot are soooo 2018, the
    teenagers of the world have all switched to the new hot app
    called BAPC (Bidirectional and Private Communication). This app
    has some stricter social rules than previous iterations. For
    example, if someone says goodbye using Later!, the other person is expected to reply
    with Alligator!. You can not keep
    track of all these social conventions and decide to automate
    any necessary responses, starting with the most important one:
    the greetings. When your conversational partner opens with
    he…ey, you have to respond with
    hee…eey as well, but using twice as
    many e’s!
Given a string of the form he…ey
    of length at most **1\,
    000**, print the greeting you will respond with,
    containing twice as many e’s.

        string **s** as
        specified, of length at least **3** and at most **1\, 000**.
